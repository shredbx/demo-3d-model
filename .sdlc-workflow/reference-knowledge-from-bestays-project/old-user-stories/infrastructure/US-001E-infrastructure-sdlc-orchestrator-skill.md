# User Story: US-001E - SDLC Orchestrator Skill (Coordinator Brain)

**Status:** READY
**Domain:** infrastructure
**Type:** feature
**Priority:** high
**Created:** 2025-11-07
**Estimated Complexity:** Large (5 days)

---

## Story

**As a** LLM (Claude Code) acting as coordinator
**I want** a single orchestrator skill that guides me through all SDLC workflow phases
**So that** I always follow the correct process (RESEARCH → PLANNING → IMPLEMENTATION → TESTING → VALIDATION) without missing critical steps

---

## Background

### Why is this needed?

We have built comprehensive SDLC infrastructure:
- `.sdlc-workflow/` (stories, tasks, templates, git workflow)
- `docs-stories` skill (CRUD for documentation)
- Planning quality gates (7 gates)
- Hooks (sdlc_guardian.py)
- Memory MCP integration
- Guidelines in CLAUDE.md

**But we lack a "conductor" skill that orchestrates the entire workflow.**

Currently, the coordinator (main Claude) must:
1. Remember which phase comes next
2. Remember which quality gates apply
3. Remember which subagents to spawn
4. Remember which artifacts to create
5. Remember what to validate before moving to next phase

**Result:** Inconsistent workflow execution, skipped steps, forgotten quality gates.

### What's the business value?

**Goal:** Ensure every user story follows the complete SDLC workflow consistently, regardless of LLM session.

**Benefits:**
- **Consistency:** Every story follows same rigorous process
- **Quality:** No skipped quality gates or validation steps
- **Efficiency:** LLM knows exactly what to do at each phase
- **Traceability:** Clear workflow state in task folders
- **Onboarding:** New LLM sessions pick up where previous left off
- **Reduced Errors:** Checklist-driven workflow prevents omissions

### SDLC Workflow Phases

From Memory MCP and CLAUDE.md:

```
RESEARCH → PLANNING → IMPLEMENTATION → TESTING → VALIDATION
```

**RESEARCH Phase:**
- Understand requirements
- Explore existing codebase
- Identify patterns to follow
- Document findings
- Output: findings-summary.md, analysis docs

**PLANNING Phase:**
- Design solution architecture
- Apply 7 quality gates (mandatory)
- Create implementation spec
- Create test plan
- Output: solution-architecture.md, implementation-spec.md, test-plan.md, quality-gate-checklist.md

**IMPLEMENTATION Phase:**
- Spawn specialized subagents (dev-backend-fastapi, dev-frontend-svelte, etc.)
- Subagents modify implementation files
- Coordinator saves reports
- Output: subagent-reports/, modified files

**TESTING Phase:**
- Run unit tests
- Run integration tests
- Run E2E tests (Playwright)
- Verify acceptance criteria
- Output: test-results/, coverage reports

**VALIDATION Phase:**
- Code review (qa-code-auditor)
- Performance check
- Security check
- Documentation check
- Output: validation-report.md, approval

### Current State

**Scattered Guidance:**
- CLAUDE.md has workflow description
- Memory MCP has workflow pattern
- planning-quality-gates skill has gates
- No single skill that guides through phases

**Problems:**
- LLM must piece together workflow from multiple sources
- Easy to skip quality gates
- Easy to forget validation steps
- No clear "state machine" for workflow progression
- No checklist for each phase

---

## Current Implementation

### What Exists Today

**SDLC Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Task folder structure with phase folders (research/, planning/, etc.)
- ✅ Planning quality gates skill
- ✅ docs-stories skill (CRUD for stories/tasks)
- ✅ Coordinator role enforcement (hooks)
- ✅ Memory MCP with patterns
- ✅ Sequential thinking requirement
- ✅ Slash commands (/task-research, /task-plan, /task-implement)

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ No orchestrator skill that guides coordinator through phases
- ❌ No phase transition checklist
- ❌ No workflow state validation
- ❌ No "what to do next" guidance
- ❌ No quality gate enforcement during planning
- ❌ No clear output requirements for each phase

---

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture

**Create `.claude/skills/sdlc-orchestrator/` skill**

**Purpose:** Guide coordinator through SDLC workflow phases with checklists, validation, and next-step guidance.

**Components:**

**1. SKILL.md** - Main orchestrator instructions
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, when to use)
- Overview of 5 phases
- **Phase-specific guidance:**
  - What to do in this phase
  - Required outputs
  - Quality checks before moving to next phase
  - Which subagents to spawn
  - Which skills to reference
- **Phase transition logic:**
  - Checklist for completing each phase
  - Validation before moving forward
  - How to update task STATE.json

**2. references/phase-checklists/** - Detailed checklists
- `research-checklist.md` - Research phase requirements
- `planning-checklist.md` - Planning phase requirements (includes 7 quality gates)
- `implementation-checklist.md` - Implementation phase requirements
- `testing-checklist.md` - Testing phase requirements
- `validation-checklist.md` - Validation phase requirements

**3. scripts/** (optional) - Automation helpers
- `phase_validator.py` - Validates phase completion
- `phase_transition.py` - Updates task state and moves to next phase

### Next Phase: COMPLETED

## Phase Transition

To move to next phase:
1. Complete all required outputs for current phase
2. Pass all quality checks for current phase
3. Update task STATE.json: `phase: "NEXT_PHASE"`
4. Use docs-stories skill to update task state
5. Continue with next phase guidance

## Workflow Validation

Before transitioning, ask:
- Did I complete all required outputs?
- Did I pass all quality checks?
- Did I document decisions and trade-offs?
- Did I update task STATE.json?

If any answer is "no", complete missing work before proceeding.
```

- Workflow confusion: "What phase am I in? What should I be doing?"
- Quality check: "Am I ready to move to implementation?"

**YAML description will trigger on:**
- "start task", "begin task"

---

## Notes

### Design Decisions

**Why a separate orchestrator skill vs. extending docs-stories?**
- Separation of concerns: docs-stories = CRUD, orchestrator = workflow guidance
- Different triggers: docs-stories for "create story", orchestrator for "what phase am I in?"
- Progressive disclosure: Load orchestrator only when coordinating workflow
- Reusability: Other projects can use orchestrator without docs-stories

**Why references/phase-checklists/?**
- Keep SKILL.md lean (< 5k words)
- Load checklists only when needed
- Progressive disclosure (metadata → SKILL.md → checklists)

**Why integrate with STATE.json?**
- Single source of truth for task phase
- Enables resumability (new LLM session sees current phase)
- docs-stories can query and update state

### Future Improvements

- Automated phase validation scripts (phase_validator.py)
- Git hooks to validate phase artifacts exist
- Visual workflow diagram in skill
- Phase duration tracking and metrics

### References

- Memory MCP: SDLC Workflow Pattern entity
- CLAUDE.md: Coordinator vs Implementer roles
- planning-quality-gates skill: 7 quality gates
- docs-stories skill: Task state management
